   - Display orders in a table format

2. **Cancel Orders**

   - Each order should have a "Cancel" button
   - Clicking cancel opens a modal with 2 buttons:
     - "Cancel with refund"
     - "Cancel without a refund"

3. **Handle Cancellation**
   - When cancellation is successful, close the modal and update the orders list
   - If there's an error, show an error message and keep the modal open
   - It should deduct the order amount from the store balance
